# Research Sources and Methodology

## Overview
This document outlines the scientific and evidence-based sources used to establish optimal nutritional requirements for the Family Meal Planning Application.

**NOTE:** We explicitly avoid WHO/FAO and FDA guidelines as these are designed to prevent deficiency diseases at a population level, not optimize health. They are often decades outdated, politically influenced, and represent minimums rather than optimal ranges.

## Key Scientific Evidence by Nutrient Category

### Macronutrients

#### Protein Requirements
- **Phillips SM, et al. (2016).** "Protein requirements and supplementation in strength sports." *Nutrition* 32(6):689-95.
  - **Finding:** 1.6g/kg body weight maximizes muscle protein synthesis
  - **RDA Comparison:** RDA 0.8g/kg only prevents deficiency, not optimal for metabolic health
  - **Application:** 112g protein for 70kg person vs RDA 56g

- **Morton RW, et al. (2018).** "A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass." *British Journal of Sports Medicine* 52(6):376-384.
  - **Finding:** Protein intakes up to 1.6g/kg show dose-response benefit for muscle maintenance in all adults (not just athletes)

#### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
- **Simopoulos AP. (2002).** "The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids." *Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy* 56(8):365-79.
  - **Finding:** Evolutionary diet omega-6:omega-3 ratio: 1:1 to 4:1
  - **Modern Problem:** Western diet ratio: 15:1 to 20:1 (highly inflammatory)
  - **Target:** 2-4g EPA+DHA daily from whole food sources

- **REDUCE-IT Trial (2019).** "Cardiovascular risk reduction with icosapent ethyl." *New England Journal of Medicine* 380:11-22.
  - **Finding:** 4g EPA daily reduced cardiovascular events 25%
  - **Application:** Emphasize fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) 3-4x weekly

### Micronutrients (Optimal vs RDA)

#### Vitamin D
- **Linus Pauling Institute Recommendation:** 2,000-4,000 IU daily for optimal serum 25(OH)D: 40-60 ng/mL

- **Holick MF. (2007).** "Vitamin D deficiency." *New England Journal of Medicine* 357(3):266-81.
  - **Finding:** Optimal levels require 4,000-5,000 IU daily (not RDA's 600 IU)
  - **Clinical Impact:** Immune function, hormone regulation, bone health, reduced autoimmune risk

- **Martineau AR, et al. (2017).** Meta-analysis: Vitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections. *BMJ* 356:i6583.
  - **Finding:** Vitamin D supplementation reduced acute respiratory infections
  - **Strongest effect:** In those with baseline deficiency (<25 ng/mL)

#### Magnesium
- **Linus Pauling Institute:** 400-420mg daily minimum; 500-600mg optimal based on cardiovascular studies

- **DiNicolantonio JJ, et al. (2018).** "Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease." *Open Heart* 5:e000668.
  - **Finding:** 48% of US population deficient; modern agriculture depletes soil magnesium
  - **RDA Problem:** 420mg RDA insufficient for optimal cardiovascular health
  - **Clinical:** Required for 300+ enzymatic reactions, ATP production

- **NHANES Data (2005-2006):** Nearly 50% of Americans consume less than the RDA for magnesium

#### Vitamin C
- **Linus Pauling Institute Recommendation:** 400mg daily for optimal health (vs RDA 90mg)

- **Frei B, et al. (2012).** "Authors' perspective: What is the optimum intake of vitamin C in humans?" *Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition* 52(9):815-29.
  - **Finding:** 200mg daily achieves near-maximal plasma concentrations
  - **Benefits:** 400-500mg from food sources shows benefits for immune function, collagen synthesis, antioxidant protection
  - **Dose-response:** Plateaus around 500mg from whole foods

#### Vitamin K2
- **Gast GC, et al. (2009).** "A high menaquinone intake reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease." *Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases* 19(7):504-10.
  - **Rotterdam Study Finding:** K2 intake >32mcg/day reduced cardiovascular mortality 50%
  - **Mechanism:** Activates matrix Gla-protein (MGP), preventing arterial calcification
  - **RDA Problem:** Government RDAs only address K1 for blood clotting, completely ignore K2 for cardiovascular/bone health
  - **Optimal:** 180-200mcg K2 (MK-7 preferred for long half-life)

#### Choline
- **Linus Pauling Institute:** 550mg daily optimal (vs RDA 425-550mg)

- **Zeisel SH, da Costa KA. (2009).** "Choline: an essential nutrient for public health." *Nutrition Reviews* 67(11):615-23.
  - **Finding:** 90% of US population deficient
  - **Critical For:** Neurotransmitter synthesis, cell membranes, methylation, liver function
  - **Best Source:** Eggs (147mg per egg); 3-4 eggs approaches optimal intake

- **NHANES Data:** <10% of population meets adequate intake levels

### Bioavailability & Food Source Comparisons

#### Heme vs Non-Heme Iron
- **Hurrell R, Egli I. (2010).** "Iron bioavailability and dietary reference values." *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* 91(5):1461S-1467S.
  - **Heme iron (animal sources):** 15-35% absorption
  - **Non-heme iron (plant sources):** 2-20% absorption
  - **Implication:** Animal iron sources significantly more bioavailable; plant-based diets require attention to iron status

#### Natural Folate vs Synthetic Folic Acid
- **Bailey RL, et al. (2015).** "Biomarkers of nutrition for development." *Journal of Nutrition* 145(5):1068S-1075S.
  - **Natural folate:** Better methylation, no masking of B12 deficiency
  - **Synthetic folic acid:** May accumulate unmetabolized, potential concerns
  - **Preference:** Whole food sources (leafy greens, legumes, liver)

## Food Quality & Toxin Avoidance Research

### Processed Oils & Oxidation
- **DiNicolantonio JJ, O'Keefe JH. (2018).** "Omega-6 vegetable oils as a driver of coronary heart disease: the oxidized linoleic acid hypothesis." *Open Heart* 5:e000898.
  - **Process:** Industrial seed oils created with high heat, hexane solvents, deodorizers
  - **Problem:** High omega-6 (15-20:1 ratio) promotes systemic inflammation
  - **Oxidation:** Linoleic acid oxidizes easily, creating harmful metabolites
  - **Excluded:** Canola, vegetable, soybean, corn, safflower oils

### GMO & Pesticide Concerns
- **Mesnage R, et al. (2015).** "Potential toxic effects of glyphosate and its commercial formulations." *BioMed Research International* 2015:179691.
  - **Finding:** Glyphosate (Roundup) disrupts gut microbiome, endocrine function
  - **GMO Connection:** GMO crops engineered for glyphosate resistance = higher residues

- **Séralini GE, et al. (2014).** "Republished study: long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide." *Environmental Sciences Europe* 26:14.
  - **Long-term effects:** Potential organ damage in animal studies
  - **Precautionary approach:** Choose organic for high-risk crops (corn, soy, canola, sugar beets)

### Modern Wheat Hybridization
- **Shewry PR, Hey SJ. (2015).** "The contribution of wheat to human diet and health." *Food and Energy Security* 4(3):178-202.
  - **Modern wheat:** 42 chromosomes (hexaploid) - heavily hybridized since 1960s
  - **Ancient einkorn:** 14 chromosomes (diploid) - original wheat species
  - **Differences:** Modern wheat has higher gluten content, lower mineral density
  - **Breeding focus:** Yield and disease resistance, NOT nutritional value
  - **Application:** Use ancient grains (einkorn, spelt, emmer) or non-grain alternatives

### Grass-Fed vs Grain-Fed Animal Products
- **Daley CA, et al. (2010).** "A review of fatty acid profiles and antioxidant content in grass-fed and grain-fed beef." *Nutrition Journal* 9:10.
  - **Omega-3 content:** 2-5x higher in grass-fed
  - **Omega-6:Omega-3 ratio:** Grass-fed 3:1, grain-fed 20:1
  - **Vitamins:** Higher vitamin E, beta-carotene, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)
  - **Application:** Prioritize grass-fed beef, pastured eggs/poultry, wild-caught fish

## Methodology for Setting Optimal Ranges

### Evidence-Based Hierarchy (Our Process)
1. **Start with Linus Pauling Institute recommendations** (optimal, not minimum)
2. **Cross-reference with Examine.com** meta-analyses
3. **Review systematic reviews & RCTs** from peer-reviewed journals
4. **Consider functional medicine biomarker targets** (e.g., vitamin D at 50 ng/mL, not 30)
5. **Evaluate evolutionary context** from anthropological research
6. **Set safety margins** using established tolerable upper intake levels (UL)
7. **Account for bioavailability** between food sources (heme vs non-heme iron, etc.)

### We DO NOT Use:
- ❌ WHO/FAO RDAs (designed to prevent deficiency diseases, not optimize health)
- ❌ FDA Daily Values (politically influenced, decades outdated)
- ❌ Government food pyramids/MyPlate (industry lobbying influence)
- ❌ Supplement industry marketing (conflict of interest)

### Setting Optimal Ranges - Example: Vitamin D
- **Government RDA:** 600 IU (prevents rickets only)
- **Linus Pauling Institute:** 2,000 IU minimum
- **Optimal blood biomarker:** 40-60 ng/mL serum 25(OH)D
- **Required intake for optimal:** 4,000 IU daily (accounting for sun exposure variation)
- **Safety margin:** Tolerable UL 10,000 IU daily
- **Our recommendation:** 2,000-4,000 IU from food + sun exposure
- **Upper limit in app:** 10,000 IU

## Food Selection Criteria

Every food in our database must meet ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Whole food**: Minimally processed, no synthetic additives or preservatives
2. **Non-GMO**: Organic or verified non-GMO sources (especially corn, soy, canola, sugar beets)
3. **Traditional/Ancestral**: Used in traditional diets for generations (not novel foods)
4. **Nutrient-dense**: High micronutrient content per calorie
5. **Bioavailable**: Nutrients in forms readily absorbed by humans
6. **Properly prepared**: Anti-nutrients reduced through soaking, fermenting, or cooking when necessary

### Excluded Foods & Rationale
- **Modern hybridized wheat** → Ancient grains only (einkorn, spelt, etc.)
- **Processed seed oils** → Whole food fats only (EVOO, nuts, seeds, avocados)
- **GMO crops** → Organic corn, soy, canola, sugar beets or avoid entirely
- **Factory-farmed animal products** → Grass-fed, pastured, wild-caught only
- **Refined sugars** → Whole fruit, raw honey in moderation
